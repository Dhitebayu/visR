<p>Alluvial/Sankey plots which are often used for assessing patterns in patient flow, e.g., consecutively received treatments. The function ‘vr_alluvial_plot’ is wrapper based on easyalluvial and parcats packages, to facilitate this task. Short tutorial below.</p>
<pre><code>#&gt; 
#&gt; Attaching package: 'dplyr'
#&gt; The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
#&gt; 
#&gt;     filter, lag
#&gt; The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
#&gt; 
#&gt;     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union</code></pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>To use this function we need to have data, which contain variables: patients ids, treatments names and lines of therapy numbers. Let’s simulate such dataset.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="no">dataset</span> <span class="kw">&lt;-</span> <span class="kw">NULL</span>

  }
}</pre></body></html></div>
<p><br></p>
<p>When we have any dataset, minimally what we need to pass to function in parameters are variable names corresponding to patients ids, treatments names and lines of therapy numbers like that:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/vr_alluvial_plot.html">vr_alluvial_plot</a></span>(<span class="no">dataset</span>,
                 <span class="kw">id</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="st">"PatientID"</span>,
                 <span class="kw">linename</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="st">"LineName"</span>,
                 <span class="kw">linenumber</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="st">"LineNumber"</span>,
                 <span class="kw">data_source</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="st">"Simulatation"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Alluvial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" alt="Alluvial plot for simulated dataset" width="700"><p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p><br></p>
<p>If you will use our package to work with Flatiron database, there is good information for you. You do not need to pass variable names because names existing in Flatiron database are taken as default, it means: (“PatientID”, “LineName”, “LineNumber”). In this case you can simply do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/vr_alluvial_plot.html">vr_alluvial_plot</a></span>(<span class="no">dataset</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Except discussed already parameters there are other important parameters. Here are all of them:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><html><body><pre class="r">#' @param n_common Number of most common lines of therapy presented in alluvial plot, Default: 2 
#' @param title plot title, Default: NULL
#' @param interactive, interactive plot, Default: FALSE
#' @param N_unit, Default: 'patients' 
#' @param data_source data source name, Default: 'Flatiron'
#' @param fill_by one_of(c('first_variable', 'last_variable', 'all_flows', 'values')), Default: 'first_variable'
#' @param col_vector_flow HEX color values for flows, Default: easyalluvial::palette_filter( greys = F)
#' @param col_vector_value HEX color values  for y levels/values, Default:RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(9, 'Blues')[c(3,6,4,7,5,8)]
#' @param linenames_labels_size, Default: 2.5</pre></body></html></div>
<p><br></p>
<p>Parameter ‘interactive’ gives possibility of seeing interactive version of plot. But remember, this is html vidget and it will not take into account parameters like ‘title’ or ‘data_source’.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/vr_alluvial_plot.html">vr_alluvial_plot</a></span>(
  <span class="no">dataset</span>,

  <span class="kw">linenumber</span> <span class="kw">=</span> <span class="st">"LineNumber"</span>,
